We will now load our freshly downloaded 'activites-list.json' data onto Google Colab and begin our Strava data-crunching.

#### Set up

1. First, we're going to need to install 'ipyleaflet' library inside our Colab to be able to use its mapping functionality later. Other libraries have been installed. Simply run the first cell to begin installation.

2. Proceed to the next cell. Click on the play button to execute it. Here, we're importing features and functionalities from our installed libraries.

#### Load Activities List File

Move on to the next cell. 

3. In this cell, we have a Python function called 'LoadStravaActivitiesList'. This function involves the use of Pandas library. We're going to use this to load our freshly downloaded 'activities-list.json' onto Colab. Apart from simply loading our JSON file, this function also:
   
   a. Converts our JSON file into an easy-to-use-and-see table format
   b. Breaks down 'latlng' column into separate 'latitude' and 'longitude' columns for ease of processing later
   c. Removes unused columns to ease the eyes
   
   Below is the cell:

   Execute the cell to let Colab know that this function exists.

4. Next, copy the 'LoadStravaActivitiesList(filepath)' from the cell and paste into a new cell under it

5. Before loading the file using this function, we'll need to first load the file into Colab's file directory. Simply drag and drop the 'activities-list.json' file from your computer onto the file directory as shown below:
   ![[6-4.png]]
   
6. Then, copy the file path of your 'activities-list.json' and paste it inside 'LoadStravaActivitiesList(filepath)'. As shown below:
   
     ![[6-6-1.png]]
     ![[6-6-2.png]]
     ![[6-6-3.png]]
    
     Don't forget to paste the file path inside ' '.

7. The output of this function will be a Pandas dataframe, which is basically a table. In this tutorial, we're going to refer to every Pandas table as a 'dataframe'. Now, we need to name the dataframe of our activities list to be able to call it inside other functions later. Simply type in the name (any name you desire) before the function and add a '=' next to it. As demonstrated below:
    ![[6-7.png]]
   
8. Re-type the name you gave this dataframe under the function or in a new cell under it. By typing only the name, we're asking the program to display the output.

	After doing the aforementioned steps, execute the cell and you should see your activities list displayed as a Pandas dataframe.
