In the previous chapters, we have:

1. Became a Strava developer
2. Created our own Strava API Application
3. Authorized Swagger Playground using our Strava tokens
4. Set up Google Colab

Now, we're going to begin retrieving and processing our Strava data.

#### Get Data From Swagger

1. Head over to Swagger. We're going to start this whole tutorial by getting our list of activities using the 'GET /athlete/activities' request, which can be found under the 'Activities' section. Click on 'GET /athlete/activities' to open it.

    Then, click 'Try it out' button to enable it.

2. Leave all the parameters blank. Change only the value inside 'Number of items per page' parameter according to the number of activities you wish to get (default there is 30). Then click 'execute'.

3. Scroll down and you should see your data displayed in JSON format, like this:

	Click 'Download', name the file 'activities-list.json', and save the file anywhere in your computer.
